# CryptoNLP
https://nlpcrypto.herokuapp.com/


" Crypto is on our clients’ minds. Their research is mainly quantitative, looking at capital flows and price analysis. We have the power to add text as
a dimension to our client’s research analysis in a new way. Currently, NLP analysis on crypto currency is little to non-existent (exists only to find
sentiment, no tagging). Tasks that require simple execution on our end will be innovative to the market due to nascency and lack of competitors.
The Design Review spells out how we can effectively enter the market and establish ourselves as first movers (time to value). "

This a proof of concept (PoC) project to showcase the ability of natural language processing to get meangingful extractions from text articles. The front end website was developed 
using ReactJS, ChakraUI, and Framer Motion on the front end.
